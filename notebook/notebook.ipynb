    "# 🚀 CareerGraph AI — Multi-Agent System using LangGraph & LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "**CareerGraph AI** is an intelligent, LLM-powered multi-agent framework designed to deliver personalized career guidance.  \n",
    "It integrates multiple specialized agents (e.g., `resume_builder`, `interview_coach`, `skill_analyzer`, etc.) within a LangGraph-based orchestration pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Key Features\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Workflow:** Dynamically routes user queries to specialized agents via a central `router`.\n",
    "- **Context-Aware Conversation:** Maintains conversational memory with summarization for long-term context.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Exit Management:** Gracefully handles user exits using a conversation-aware `exit_chain`.\n",
    "- **Agent Specialization:**\n",
    "  - 🧭 `learning_path_advisor` — Personalized learning recommendations  \n",
    "  - 🧠 `skill_analyzer` — Analyzes and improves skill portfolios  \n",
    "  - 💼 `resume_builder` — Generates ATS-friendly resumes  \n",
    "  - 🎯 `interview_coach` — Provides tailored interview preparation  \n",
    "  - 🎓 `course_recommender` & `project_recommender` — Suggests career-enhancing projects and courses  \n",
    "- **Graph-Based Architecture:** Built using `LangGraph` with conditional routing and sequential agent execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Components Overview\n",
    "1. **StateGraph Setup:** Defines all nodes and transitions between agents.  \n",
    "2. **Agent Nodes:** Each agent operates as a modular function processing the shared `state`.  \n",
    "3. **Conversation Loop:** Interactive CLI loop that handles user input, memory, and routing.  \n",

    "#### Purpose\n",
    "This agent provides **personalized interview preparation guidance** by leveraging:\n",
    "- The **job description**,  \n",
    "- The **user’s resume**, or  \n",
    "- Other available **profile data** in the system state.\n",
    "\n",
    "It adapts dynamically based on which inputs are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Available | Behavior |\n",
    "|----------------|-----------|\n",
    "| Resume + JD | Tailored prep plan aligned with both |\n",
    "| Only JD | Focus on job role, company, and required skills |\n",
    "| Only Resume | Focus on candidate’s profile and experience |\n",
    "| None | Uses user’s state-level skill, project, and education info |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Output Sections\n",
    "1. **Role Context** — brief overview of the target job or domain.  \n",
    "2. **Key Focus Areas** — what the candidate should emphasize.  \n",
    "3. **Likely Technical Questions** — predicted domain-specific questions.  \n",
    "4. **Behavioral Questions** — HR and situational queries.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "The agent:\n",
    "1. Collects context from:\n",
    "   - `metadata[\"job_description\"]`\n",
    "   - `metadata[\"resume_data\"]`\n",
    "   - or `state` fields like skills, projects, education.\n",
    "2. Builds a unified **context summary** for the LLM.\n",
    "3. Uses a **structured prompt** to instruct the LLM.\n",
    "4. Returns a comprehensive, structured response in `state[\"response\"]`."

    "The `resume_builder` agent of **CareerGraph AI** intelligently generates, enhances, and tailors resumes using available user data, resume uploads, job descriptions, and contextual memory.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Behavior Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Available | Agent Behavior |\n",
    "|----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| ✅ Job Description + Resume | Creates a fully tailored resume matching the job requirements and user background. |\n",
    "| ✅ Job Description only | Builds a new resume using stored profile data aligned with the JD. |\n",
    "| ✅ Resume only | Improves and optimizes the uploaded resume for ATS and clarity. |\n",
    "| ❌ None available | Generates a professional resume purely from the user's stored profile data. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processing Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Extraction**  \n",
    "   - Reads job description and resume data from the `metadata` field.  \n",
    "   - Pulls additional details from user’s stored `skills`, `experience`, etc.  \n",
    "   - Integrates prior interaction context via `memory_summary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Tailoring**  \n",
    "   - Chooses one of four logic branches depending on data presence.  \n",
    "   - Builds a context string combining JD, Resume, and/or Profile data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM Prompting Flow**  \n",
    "   - Uses a system + human prompt via `ChatPromptTemplate`.  \n",
    "   - The system prompt defines a two-phase process:  \n",
    "     - **Phase 1 — ATS Engine:** Generates 5 unique resume drafts.  \n",
    "     - **Phase 2 — HR Reviewer:** Selects the single best version.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Output**  \n",
    "   - Produces **only one complete resume**, properly formatted.  \n",

    "#### Core Features\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Exit Detection** | Uses a lightweight LLM prompt to check if user says “bye”, “exit”, etc. |\n",
    "| **Memory Management** | Keeps last 10 user–AI exchanges in a rolling list |\n",
    "| **Summarized Context** | Compresses prior conversation into 5-sentence summary for continuity |\n",
    "| **Dynamic Agent Routing** | Sends each user query to the right agent via the LangGraph app |\n",
    "| **Persistent Flow** | Continues the session until user explicitly ends it |\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Flow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input → Exit Check**  \n",
    "   - If user says “bye”, AI politely ends the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Update → Context Summary**  \n",

      "AI: Docker and Kubernetes are foundational technologies, especially crucial for your journey towards becoming a proficient AI Engineer, as we discussed previously. They are key components for building robust, scalable, and production-ready AI systems, particularly when deploying modern LLM applications in cloud environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of how they are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Docker:\n",
      "Docker is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. These containers are isolated, portable environments that bundle an application and all its dependencies (code, runtime, system tools, libraries, settings) into a single, consistent unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it is for AI/ML Engineers:\n",
      "  Dependency Management: AI/ML projects often have complex dependencies (specific Python versions, libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, CUDA versions for GPU access). Docker ensures that your model runs in the exact environment it was developed in, preventing \"it works on my machine\" issues.\n",
      "  Reproducibility: It makes your experiments and deployments highly reproducible across different machines or environments (local, staging, production).\n",
      "  Portability: You can easily move your trained models and inference services from your local machine to a cloud server or an on-premise cluster without worrying about environment setup.\n",
      "  Resource Isolation: Containers provide a degree of isolation, which can be useful for managing resources when running multiple AI services on the same host.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kubernetes (K8s):\n",
      "Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. While Docker creates the individual containers, Kubernetes manages them at scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it is for AI/ML Engineers:\n",
      "  Scalability: AI applications, especially LLM services, often need to scale dynamically based on demand. Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of running containers (pods) up or down to handle varying loads, ensuring your application remains responsive.\n",
      "  High Availability: It can automatically restart failed containers, reschedule them on healthy nodes, and distribute traffic, ensuring your AI services are continuously available.\n",
      "  Resource Management: Kubernetes efficiently manages computing resources (CPU, memory, GPU) across a cluster, allowing you to run multiple AI workloads optimally.\n",
      "  Deployment Automation: It streamlines the deployment process for your AI models and services, enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.\n",
      "  MLOps Foundation: Kubernetes is a cornerstone of MLOps, providing the infrastructure for deploying, monitoring, and managing the lifecycle of machine learning models in production. This includes serving models via APIs, running batch inference jobs, and managing data pipelines.\n",
      "  GPU Scheduling: For deep learning workloads, Kubernetes can be configured to schedule containers on nodes with available GPUs, which is critical for performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Docker provides the packaging and consistent environment for your AI applications, while Kubernetes provides the robust framework to deploy, manage, and scale those containerized applications in a production setting. Mastering both will equip you with essential skills for building and operating modern AI systems, aligning perfectly with the AI Engineer roadmap we outlined.\n",
